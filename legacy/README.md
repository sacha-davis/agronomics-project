# Legacy README
This folder holds files that may be of interest to viewers of this repo, but are no longer necessary to recreate the functionality of the project.

The folder `early_versions` contains code and results I used while prototyping what is now `src/MLME-v2.0-conv_model.py`. These should be runnable with the base environment, but it's not recommended because how the notebooks save results is not up-to-date with the current directory structure. If you are interested in using this functionality, please use to the final version I mentioned earlier.

 `kipoi` contains code that uses the Kipoi Model Zoo version of the MPRA-DragoNN code. In order to run these notebooks, you will find instructions within the `kipoi` folder README.
